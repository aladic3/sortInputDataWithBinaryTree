**“CSV Sorter” is a CLI application that allows sorting of its input presented as CSV-text.**
<p text-align = "center"> **Technical details** </p>
	Required features:
	*<ul>
	<li>The application runs as a CLI application.</li> 
	<li>It reads STDIN line by line. The end of the input is an empty line.</li>
	<li>Each line is a list of comma-separated values (CSV). Each value is considered as a piece of text. The number of values is the same in each line.</li>
	<li>The application sorts all lines alphabetically by the first value in each line.</li>
	<li>The application prints the result immediately, when the user ends to enter input text (presses <Enter> at a new line).</li>
</ul>*
	Optional features (not required but appreciated):
	[^1]The application supports options:
		Option usage Meaning
	*	
	<ul>
	<li>-i file-name Use a file with the name file-name as an input.</li>
	<li>-o file-name Use a file with the name file-name as an output.</li>
	<li>-h The first line is a header that must be ignored during sorting but included in the output.</li>
	<li>-f N Sort input lines by value number N.</li>
	<li>-r Sort input lines in reverse order.</li>
	</ul>
	*		
			
			
			
			
	2. Add the ability to use a second algorithm for sorting - the Tree Sort algorithm. Accordingly, add one
	more option -a with possible values 1 or 2, which chooses currently implemented algorithm or
	Tree Sort algorithm to use. By default, the application uses the currently implemented algorithm.
